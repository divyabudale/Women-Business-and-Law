## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation <a name = "motivation"></a>
For this project, I wanted to understand the Women, Business and Law to study gender inequality in the law by answering the following questions:

1. What is the average WBL Index over the Region between 2015-2019
2. Which region made the most progress between 2015-2019?
4. Number of Economy per Region with over 90 WBL INDEX as of 2019
5. Which countries in each Region are the best and worst for a women?
7. Which indicators have the largest gap to fill?
8. In which indicator have the economies introducing the most reform?
9. Analyzing the factors related to the WBL INDEX
10. How many countries need to step up in each indicator?

## File Description <a name = "files"></a>
